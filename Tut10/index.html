    <!-- src: Specifies the path to the video file.
         controls: Adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

         <!-- preload: Specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads ('auto', 'metadata', 'none'). -->
         <!-- The "preload" attribute can have the following values:
            
            none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file  at all. The audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.
            
            metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file, such as  its duration and basic information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the  audio duration to the user without fully loading the audio data.
            
            auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible  without delaying the loading of other important page content. The browser will try to load the  audio file in the background so that it's ready to play when the user decides to start it. -->

                 SVG graphics are scalable, and do not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized:
                 SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
                 SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
                 SVG defines graphics in XML format
                 Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated
                 SVG is a W3C recommendation
                 SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM, XSL and JavaScript -->

            <!-- An iFrame is an HTML element that enables an inline frame for the embedding of external content, Essentially, you can load another web page within a designated area of your current webpage.

            Why Use iFrames?
            iFrames offer a variety of use-cases:
            Content Isolation: iFrames allow you to isolate third-party content, which can improve security.
            Modularity: Easily embed external plugins, widgets, or content.
            Resource Separation: Content within an iFrame can load separately from the rest of the page. -->
