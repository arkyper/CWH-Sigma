    <!-- HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

    Why Use HTML Entities?
    Here are some reasons:

    Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
    Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
    Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line. -->

    <!-- &lt;  for <
    &gt;  for >
    &amp; for &
    &nbsp; for a non-breaking space
    &copy; for © -->
