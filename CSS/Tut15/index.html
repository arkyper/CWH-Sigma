    <h3 style="color: red; background-color: greenyellow;">Inline CSS: is used to add custom properties to specific elements. The added style will only reflect on that particular element only. To use inline CSS, Insert the "style" attribute within the HTML element's opening tag</h3>

    <div>
        Internal CSS: is used to apply custom style to the multiple elements on the same page. The style can be used throughout the HTML page. Internal CSS is defined in a style block, which will be inside the head section
    </div>

    <p>External CSS: works similarly to internal CSS but with a twist. Instead of adding the styles within the HTML file, we create a separate file with .css extension. This file will hold all the styling details. Then, we link this file to the HTML page, giving it the instructions on how to look. </p>
